Version 11C (2010-05-21)
======================

- Issue 001 : Added support for display of file queue size over 4 gigabytes
   The old datatype used was an unsigned int which limited the display size of the queue to 
   4194 MB.  Adding more than that would cause the counter to roll back over.  This means adding 
   4195 MB would cause it to display as if only 1 MB was in the queue.  The new datatype is an 
   unsigned int64 which will accomodate 18014398509481 MB.

   An additional unit size of GB has been added to the queue size display as well.  After 51200 MB
   the counter size will switch over to GB.

   NOTE:  As a consequence of this change HISTORY.DAT files generated with previous versions will 
   not display their contents properly.
